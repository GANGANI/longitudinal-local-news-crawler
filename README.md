# Longitudinal Local News Crawler

This Python-based crawler scrapes and archives local news articles from various media publications using RSS feeds and direct website scraping. It stores the collected articles in `.wacz` format and optionally uploads them to the Internet Archive.

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/GANGANI/longitudinal-local-news-crawler.git
      cd longitudinal-local-news-crawler
      ```

3. **Install dependencies**

      Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
4. **Install Docker:**

     - The crawler uses Browsertrix Crawler via Docker to archive webpages.
     - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
     - Run the following command
       ```bash
       docker pull webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler
       ```
       
5. **Internet Archive Upload (Optional)**
   - If internetarchive credentials are configured and Docker is running, the `.wacz` files will be uploaded to archive.org.
   - To configure credentials:
      ```bash
      ia configure
      ```

6. **Setup Cronjos**
  - Edit cronjobs by running the following command
    ```bash
    cronjob -e
    ```
  - Then add the following line to set up regular verification of wacz file uploads and delete from the local if you are uploading wacz files to

Summary
- **Max number of websites per website: 657 (CA)**
- **Min number of websites per website: 32 (DE)**

  
## Processing time 

- **Estimated time per website**: approximately 480 seconds
- **Sequentially** = 9338 websites * 480 sec = 4,481,600 sec = 52 days (To run all websites, it will take 52 days)
- **Required parallelism** = Total time / seconds per day
                           = (9,338 websites * 480 sec) / 86,400 sec
                           = 52 workers
                           
  - Within 1 day, only 180 websites (86400/480)
  - To parallelize, 52 tasks should run in parallel (9339/180)
  
  
  **High-Level Strategy**
  - Split the 9338 websites into batches (180 per job)
  - Multiple HPC jobs in parallel (52 jobs)

## Storage requirements

- I have collected wacz files for AK state for june 13, 14, 15, 16 (But from 16th, it has been stopped due to lack of space)
- Eventhough above analysis shows, AK state has 82 working websites, I only got results from61 websites.
- The maximum file size is 5GB(us-local-news-data-AK-2025-6/14/kyuk.org/kyuk-org-20250614T161710.wacz)
- The minimum file size is 4MB(us-local-news-data-AK-2025-6/15/650keni.iheart.com/650keni-iheart-com-20250615T142607.wacz)
- On average 200MB per file(770 items, totalling 146.8¬†GB)

## Estimated Bandwidth Usage

1. Website Crawling
- Average crawl size per site: ~50 MB 
- Per day: 9338 √ó 50 MB avg = ~466 GB/day (just for crawling)

2. WACZ Uploading
A single .wacz file can be:
- Small: ~5 MB
- Large: 100‚Äì300 MB (pages with media)
- Estimate: average 50 MB per WACZ
- 9338 √ó 50 MB = ~466 GB/day upload bandwidth

3. Total
- Crawling	~466 GB (download)
- Uploading	~466 GB (upload)
- Total	~900‚Äì1000 GB/day

So it seems we require ~1 TB of bandwidth daily

## Tasks for Cron Jobs
- First store WACZ locally, then batch-upload periodically using a cron job (every hour)
- Daily, check if batch jobs are still running or have failed. If it fails, send an email
- Verify uploads and delete warcz files weekly
- Generate a report monthly/weekly summarizing archived, failed, skipped, per state
- Notify if the errors exceed a threshold.

## Questions
- Executing docker in HPC
