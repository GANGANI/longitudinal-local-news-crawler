Processing time Samples
- for http://www.adn.com/: 450.15 seconds
- for http://www.alaskajournal.com/: 366.24 seconds
- for http://www.alaska-native-news.com/: 365.13 seconds
- for http://www.deltawindonline.com/: 373.37 seconds

It is taking nearly **480 seconds** processing time per website. 

**Sequentially** = 9338 websites * 480 sec = 4,481,600 sec = 52 days (To run all websites, it will take 52 days)

Within 1 day, only 180 websites (86400/480)
To parallelize 52 tasks should run in parallel (9339/180)

**Required parallelism** = Total time / seconds per day
                         = (9,338 websites * 480 sec) / 86,400 sec
                         = 52 workers

**High-Level Strategy**
- Split the 9338 websites into batches (180 per job)
- Multiple HPC jobs in parallel (52 jobs)

**Tasks for Cron Jobs**
- Daily, check if batch jobs are still running or have failed. If it fails, send an email
- Verify uploads and delete warcz files weekly
- Generate a report monthly/weekly summarizing archived, failed, skipped, per state
- Notify if the errors exceed a threshold.
